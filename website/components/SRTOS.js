                <p>
                    The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
                    entity
                    in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which
                    would
                    subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
                    choose
                    to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for
                    compliance with
                    local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and
                    Accountability
                    Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be
                    subjected to such
                    laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate the
                    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

                    right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal

                    is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed
                    severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
                    provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us

                    electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
